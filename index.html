                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My journey has been a whirlwind of challenges and triumphs, each one shaping me into the person I am today. Back in grade 9, I took on the Rubik's Cube competition with passion and precision. I won 1st place in the school, district, and regional divisions, and then at the national level in Baguio, I proudly placed 3rd among thousands of competitors. A fun fact: I can even solve a Rubik's Cube underwater!</p>
                <br>
                <p>In grade 11, I took my first steps into the world of dance when I was invited to join MUVAPOW, a group from Bauang Technical High School. We were chosen to represent our school at the LPU competition, and though we had only 3 days to practice, we managed to take home the championship. That experience marked the beginning of my deep connection to dance. Then came the pandemic, during which I focused on working out and building strength. After the world reopened, I dived back into dancing, competing both locally in Batangas and internationally. Representing the Philippines in South Korea, I was honored to place 3rd in a fierce international competition.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Alongside all these milestones, I also took on the challenge of being a working student, learning valuable lessons in both life and time management. Each experience has taught me the importance of dedication, resilience, and always pushing myself to achieve more.</p>

                <h1>Experience</h1>
                <p>Hi, I'm Jaynor, a 21-year-old Information Technology student at Westmead International High School. When I’m not buried in code or working on my thesis, you’ll find me singing, dancing, or diving into online games on my PC or mobile. My passion for programming has only grown, and I’m excited to see where it takes me.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I'm also a dancer—currently balancing studies and performances. Recently, I had the honor of representing the Philippines in South Korea, where I helped my team earn 2nd place among 9 competing countries. It was a proud moment and a testament to the hard work and dedication I’ve put into both my studies and my craft.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Beyond dancing, I love singing and graphic design. Whether I’m crafting visuals or belting out a tune, creativity is my constant companion. My life motto is simple but powerful: “Have will, and You Will.” It’s a reminder to keep pushing forward, no matter what.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thanks for stopping by and getting to know a bit about me!</p>
